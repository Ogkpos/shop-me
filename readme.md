- Big Shout-out to [Jonas Schmedtmann](https://github.com/jonasschmedtmann) 🙏🙏 for helping me to create this ecommerce application.

### ShopMe Api 📴

- It is created using node, express and mongodb.
- You can see the api documentation 👉 [ShopMe Api](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/25556342/2s9YCBu9jo).

### Limitation 😥

- It is not responsive at all mainly developed for web or large screen(1920 - 1080). So if u want to view on your screen zoom out a bit. Thank you 🙏.
- It is based on simple view and buy feature app so you can't remove the order or add products to the cart.
- You can buy the product one at a time.
